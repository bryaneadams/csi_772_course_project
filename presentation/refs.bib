abstract={Given the ever increasing amount of information required in today's fast-changing work environment, employers are becoming concerned that their employees will not have the knowledge base necessary to perform their jobs.  Several steps need to be taken before employers will be able to ensure that their employees have the requisite knowledge to perform their jobs. First, knowledge must be defined in job-relevant terms. Second, a taxonomy of knowledge areas that are relevant to the wide variety of jobs in the economy must be identified, and a measurement system for identifying and quantifying the knowledges must be developed. Third, data must be gathered to provide evidence for the comprehensiveness of the new knowledge taxonomy and the reliability and validity of the measurement system.  This chapter describes the development and evaluation of a taxonomy of job-required knowledges and its associated measurement system. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for a variety of human resource functions in the world of work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract={The authors provide initial answers to some of the questions surrounding occupational skill requirements. They begin by reviewing what is known about occupational skills and propose a working definition for them. They then present some initial evidence bearing on the reliability and validity of these measures and examine its implications for answering certain questions about workforce skills.

abstract={This chapter describes a comprehensive taxonomic system for describing and classifying jobs in terms of the abilities required to perform these jobs effectively. The taxonomic system provided is comprehensive in its coverage of the cognitive, psychomotor, physical and sensory-perceptual domains of human abilities and is applicable to the full range of jobs found in the world economy. Specifically, the chapter provides the conceptual background of the taxonomic system, the developmental background of this taxonomy, and the development of the measurement system that uses the taxonomy in assessing the ability requirements of jobs. The system is evaluated in terms of its reliability, validity, and utility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

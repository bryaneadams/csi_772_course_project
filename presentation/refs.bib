abstract={Given the ever increasing amount of information required in today's fast-changing work environment, employers are becoming concerned that their employees will not have the knowledge base necessary to perform their jobs.  Several steps need to be taken before employers will be able to ensure that their employees have the requisite knowledge to perform their jobs. First, knowledge must be defined in job-relevant terms. Second, a taxonomy of knowledge areas that are relevant to the wide variety of jobs in the economy must be identified, and a measurement system for identifying and quantifying the knowledges must be developed. Third, data must be gathered to provide evidence for the comprehensiveness of the new knowledge taxonomy and the reliability and validity of the measurement system.  This chapter describes the development and evaluation of a taxonomy of job-required knowledges and its associated measurement system. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for a variety of human resource functions in the world of work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{diversification,
	abstract = {Abstract Because of the importance of human capital, a firm's choice of diversification targets will depend on whether these targets offer opportunities for leveraging existing human resources. We propose to quantify the similarity of different industries' human capital or skill requirements, that is, the industries' skill relatedness, by using information on cross-industry labor flows. Labor flows among industries can be used to identify skill relatedness, because individuals changing jobs will likely remain in industries that value the skills associated with their previous work. Estimates show that firms are far more likely to diversify into industries that have ties to the firms' core activities in terms of our skill-relatedness measure than into industries without such ties or into industries that are linked by value chain linkages or by classification-based relatedness.

    abstract = {Whom you work with matters: skill complementarity with co-workers influences careers, wages and returns to education. As individuals specialize in specific knowledge areas, a society's know-how becomes distributed across different workers. To use this distributed know-how, workers must be coordinated into teams that, collectively, can cover a wide range of expertise. This paper studies the interdependencies among co-workers that result from this process in a population-wide dataset covering educational specializations of millions of workers and their co-workers in Sweden over a 10-year period. The analysis shows that the value of what a person knows depends on whom that person works with. Whereas having co-workers with qualifications similar to one's own is costly, having co-workers with complementary qualifications is beneficial. This co-worker complementarity increases over a worker's career and offers a unifying framework to explain seemingly disparate observations, answering questions such as ‚ÄúWhy do returns to education differ so widely?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy do workers earn higher wages in large establishments?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are wages so high in large cities?‚Äù}

@article{human_capital_specificity,
	abstract = { Measures of four basic skills, constructed from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, are used to examine the source of human capital specificity. The measures are used to characterize the skill portfolio of each job and to construct distance measures between jobs. Wage losses in the Displaced Worker Surveys are shown to be more closely associated with switching skill portfolios than switching industry or occupation code per se. These switches represent large decreases in the skill portfolio in the postdisplacement job. The recent evidence for industry‚Äêspecific capital is reexamined. The results suggest a difference between fluid and crystallized skills. },

 abstract = {Results from the Displaced Worker Surveys show that the wage cost of switching industries following displacement is strongly correlated with predisplacement measures of both work experience and tenure. Workers apparently receive compensation for some skills that are neither completely general nor firm-specific but rather specific to their industry or line of work. Further, among displaced workers who find new jobs in their predisplacement industry, postdisplacement returns to predisplacement job tenure resemble cross-section estimates of the returns to current seniority. This suggests that firm-specific factors may contribute little to the observed slope of wage tenure profiles.},

Using rich data on tasks performed in occupations, we propose the concept of task‚Äêspecific human capital to measure empirically the transferability of skills across occupations. Our results on occupational mobility and wages show that labor market skills are more portable than previously considered. We find that individuals move to occupations with similar task requirements and that the distance of moves declines with experience. We also show that task‚Äêspecific human capital is an important source of individual wage growth, accounting for up to 52% of overall wage growth.},
